* Latest, major updates made to the skin (ranking panel, selection mod menu, score numbers, input overlay etc.)
- No changes made to failed and paused backgrounds as well as the continue, replay, retry and exit buttons (same case for the perfect text but on replay, unranked text has been removed since the scorebar was blocking it)
